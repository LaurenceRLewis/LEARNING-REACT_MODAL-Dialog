        Veganism is a lifestyle and dietary choice that seeks to exclude the use
        of animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose. Adopting a vegan
        lifestyle means avoiding meat, dairy, eggs, and other animal products,
        as well as products that have been tested on animals.

      <p>
        One of the primary reasons for going vegan is to reduce animal
        suffering. By choosing not to consume animal products, vegans are
        advocating for a more humane and compassionate world. In addition,
        veganism has been linked to numerous health benefits, such as a reduced
        risk of heart disease, certain types of cancer, and obesity. It is also
        a more environmentally sustainable choice, as animal agriculture is a
        significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation.
